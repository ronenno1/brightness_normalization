This matlab code takes a folder with images and does the following:

calculation of the brightness for each picture.
calculation of the "grand" mean brightness for all the pictures (it's optional – it’s possible to provide any other “grand" mean for the next steps).
taking each picture and make it brighter / darker until the new brightness will be equal (as much as possible) to the "grand" mean.
saving the new normalized picture in a dedicate folder (called "new") inside the given folder.
calculation of the brightness for each new picture.
All the values of the brightness (both original and new) will be saved on dedicate csv file ("output.csv").


This code is extremely easy to use and could be useful in case you want to check the brightness of your stimuli and also if you want / need to present stimuli with the same brightness.
